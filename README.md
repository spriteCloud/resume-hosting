# Quality Assurance Architect

_Architect (Quality Assurance & Test Automation Software)_ <br>

I excel at transforming quality assurance within organisations and establishing software automations(for test & business) that are continuously integrated, easy to maintain, highly sustainable & efficient in execution. My main objective is to optimise quality assurance within organisations while reducing costs of certain tasks by automating them as efficiently as possible. I believe automation is necessary not just for testing but for any task that can benefit from it, and I am up to the task. <br>
